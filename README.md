This project is a collection of programs that help to sniff the Lightning cable or manipulate what is transmitted.

Each folder is one program:
 - [**acc_id_sniff**](acc_id_sniff/): Sniff the ACC_ID pin.
 - [**acc_id_spoof**](acc_id_spoof/): Use your Arduino to identify as a genuine lightning controller.
 - [**serial_sniff**](serial_sniff/): Sniff the UART bus of a serial accessory using an Arduino.
 - [**serial_mitm**](serial_mitm/): Let a MFI accessory authenticates to the iDevice and then hijack the serial bus.
 - [**ios_app**](ios_app/): A simple iOS app to send abritary text to an external accessory and see the response.

Details about how you can use these programs are to be found in [Freedelity's blog](http://blog.freedelity.be/fr/blogs_message-49-1-Hacking_the_Lighning_cable__let_s_talk_tech.html)
